## Overview
For project three, I created a Health and Wellness Tracker

When users come to they can see all users listed, and select their user account. Future iterations will have functional login options. Users can then go to their dashboard where currently displayed is the daily recommended water intake, and a button to increase water intake. A dropdown button displays historical data, populated from the database. Finally, Show Food allows a user to see what food they have confused that day, add new food to the database, and add food from the database to their day.

### Food Actions

The user can create a new food item for the global database. Then, a user may add any food item from the global database to his/her own daily intake. 

Once there, a user can edit an item, (for example, if you ate banana pudding instead of a banana) and/or delete that item.

Bug: 

### Scoring
If either the player, or the dealer reaches 21 with their initial 2 cards, it is known as a blackjack, and play stops immediately. 

A hand totalling 22 points or higher is known as a bust, and is an immediate loss.
